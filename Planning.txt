load books from JSON file
turn each book into a Book object

    ask user for a number

    if they pick "view books":
        print only the books that are available

    if they pick "search":
        ask if searching by title, author, or genre
        get search text
        show any books that match the text

    if they pick "checkout":
        ask for a book ID
        find that book
        if it's available, mark it checked out and set due date

    if they pick "return":
        ask for a book ID
        find that book
        mark it available again (clear due date)

    if they pick "overdue list":
        look at all books that are checked out AND past their due date
        show those

    if they pick "top 3":
        sort books by checkout count (biggest first)
        print the first 3

    if they pick "add a book":
        figure out next book ID (find largest B#, add 1)
        ask for title, author, genre
        create a new Book object
        add to books_catalog

    if they pick "exit":
        save all the books back into JSON file
        stop loop
